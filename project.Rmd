# Task 1
Needed packages:
```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
installed.packages("data.table")
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE , echo=T, results="hide"}
library(data.table)
```

## Subtask 1
```{r}
# Read frome the snapshot, select only columns we're interested in.
matches <- fread(paste0(getwd(), "/data/matches.csv"), select=c("match_id", "match_hometeam_name", "match_awayteam_name", "league_id","match_status","match_hometeam_score", "match_awayteam_score"))
# get only finished english premier league matches
finished_epl_matches <- matches[league_id == 148 & match_status == "Finished"]
finished_epl_matches[, outcome := (ifelse(match_hometeam_score == match_awayteam_score, 0 , ifelse(match_hometeam_score > match_awayteam_score, 1 , -1)))]
finished_epl_matches
```

# Task 2
```{r}
# read bets csv
bets <- fread(paste0(getwd(), "/data/bets.csv"))
# add column to indicate if match ended as draw
# get only bets data with win, draw or lose.
bets <- bets[variable %in% c("odd_1", "odd_x", "odd_2" )]
# join bets and match data by match_id
merged_data <- merge(finished_epl_matches, bets, by='match_id')
merged_data
```

### Custom functions:
```{r}

  RPS = apply((probs-outcomes)^2,1,sum) / (ncol(probs)-1)
  return(RPS)
